      <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
      <p> 
        Every character in The Great Gatsby draws inspiration from the American Dream's promise of wealth and prosperity. At the same time, the novel itself critiques the notion of the American Dream. Readers may end the novel wondering if the American Dream is actually attainable at all.</p>
